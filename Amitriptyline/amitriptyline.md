## Background
[**Amitriptyline**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amitriptyline) is an antidepressant of the [tricyclic class](https://en.wikipedia.org/Tricyclic_antidepressant), that is on the [World Health Organization's Model List of Essential Medicines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Health_Organization's_Model_List_of_Essential_Medicines) (WHO-EM), as both an antidepressant and as a [palliative care](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palliative_care) drug (most likely due to its sedating, [neuropathic pain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuropathic_pain)-relieving, antidepressant and antidiarrhoeal effects). 

Amitriptyline was one of the first antidepressants to receive regulatory approval (ca. 1960), yet is still widely prescribed and has shown some unique effects in preclinical studies. For example, it, unlike other antidepressants, seems to directly activate [tropomyosin receptor kinase A](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropomyosin_receptor_kinase_A) (TrkA) and [B](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropomyosin_receptor_kinase_B) (TrkB) receptors, which are, the receptors of [nerve growth factor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nerve_growth_factor) (NGF) and [brain-derived neurotrophic factor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain_derived_growth_factor) (BDNF). It also has shown signs of slight superiority over other antidepressants in clinical studies,<sup>1</sup> in terms of its efficacy, although its side effects tend to be worse than the newer antidepressants. Additionally it is used to treat/prevent several conditions as a second-line, third-line,investigational or even treatment of last resort. Such conditions include, but are not limited to:

* Migraines, in which it is used to prevent migraines, not so much treat them. 
* Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), especially where diarrhoea dominates. 
* Nocturnal enuresis (bedwetting), for which it actually has regulatory approval in Australia.
* Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), its metabolite nortriptyline is more likely to be used for this purpose, however, as it is less sedating. 
* Insomnia, although generally not recommended.
* Cyclic vomiting syndrome (CVS)
