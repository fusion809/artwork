# Artwork
This repository is essentially a place to store my artwork. I will admit I'm not much of an artist and most, if not all, of these pretty much any one can build with Jmol, Avogadro2 and GIMP, so long as they know the basics of using these applications. 

Nonetheless I felt these were worth being displayed in a nice public and open way.
