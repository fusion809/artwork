# Artwork
This repository is essentially a place to store my artwork. I will admit I'm not much of an artist and most, if not all, of these pretty much any one can build with Jmol, Avogadro2 and GIMP, so long as they know the basics of using these applications. Nonetheless I felt these were worth being displayed in a nice public and open way. 

The ones I believe are especially pretty I upload to openDesktop.org, at https://www.opendesktop.org/p/1236103/.

Everything but the skeletal images were created entirely using open-source software. Sadly, I haven't found a good quality open-source skeletal structure drawing program, at least none similar in quality to MarvinSketch. 

If you like the artwork here please consider starring this repository and/or upvoting the artwork on openDesktop.org.
