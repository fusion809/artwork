# Artwork
This repository is essentially a place to store my artwork. I will admit I'm not much of an artist and most, if not all, of these pretty much any one can build with Jmol, Avogadro2 and GIMP, so long as they know the basics of using these applications. Nonetheless I felt these were worth being displayed in a nice public and open way. 

The ones I believe are especially pretty I upload to openDesktop.org, at https://www.opendesktop.org/p/1236103/.

Everything but the skeletal images were created entirely using open-source software. Sadly, I haven't found a good quality open-source skeletal structure drawing program, at least none similar in quality to MarvinSketch. If you know of one that can:

* Import the molecule by name (i.e. I enter their common (not necessarily IUPAC) name and it downloads a structure file for them from an online source and imports it)
* Handle a variety of molecule file formats
* Can do chemical calculations (like count the number of each atom, approximate molecular mass, *etc.*)
* Can export to SVG and PNG image formats, with transparency
* Can have their drawing style (e.g. fonts, length of bonds, distance between hashes in downward bonds, *etc.*) extensively customized. 

please tell me. I already know that:

* BKChem
* GChemPaint
* JChemPaint

can't. For starters, they cannot have the molecule imported by name.  

If you like the artwork here please consider starring this repository and/or upvoting the artwork on openDesktop.org.
