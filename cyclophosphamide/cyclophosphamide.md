## Background
[**Cyclophosphamide**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclophosphamide) is arguably the single most widely used chemotherapy drug, with possible rivals for this title including [methotrexate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methotrexate). It is an [alkylating agent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alkylating_agent) of the [nitrogen mustard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen_mustard) class with selectivity for cells expressing low levels of [aldehyde dehydrogenase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aldehyde_dehydrogenase) (ALDH, which also metabolizes acetaldehyde, from alcohol consumption, into acetic acid; genetic defects leading to reduced ALDH function often lead to an increased 'hangover' effect from alcohol), which includes lymphocytes and malignant (cancer) cells. ALDH metabolizes a key metabolite of cyclophosphamide, aldophosphamide, into the inactive metabolite carboxycyclophosphamide, reducing the proportion of it that is metabolized into the active metabolite, phosphoramide mustard, which alkylates (or chemically alters) DNA, thereby inhibiting its replication and triggering [apoptosis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apoptosis) (programmed cell death, essentially cell suicide). It too is on the WHO-EM and is also used in veterinary practice to treat a variety of malignancies and [autoimmune diseases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autoimmune_disease).
