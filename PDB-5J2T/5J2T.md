[5J2T](http://www.rcsb.org/structure/5J2T)is a cow (*Bos taurus*) [tubulin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tubulin) (chains A and C of alpha-1B and chains D and B of beta-2B)-[vinblastine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vinblastine) complex, with [brown rat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brown_rat) (*Rattus norvegicus*) [stathmin-4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stathmin-4) (chain E) and [red junglefowl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_junglefowl) (*Gallus gallus*) [tubulin-tyrosine ligase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tubulinâ€”tyrosine_ligase) (chain F).

Binding to tubulin is how [vinca alkaloids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vinca_alkaloid) like vinblastine work to inhibit cell division and thereby inhibit cancer growth. Vinca alkaloids form the backbone of many chemotherapy regimens, most notably COP/CHOP with the O standing for Oncovin, which is a brand name of vincristine.

The vinca alkaloids all come from (vinblastine and vincristine being the most notable examples), or are synthesized from compounds that come from (which is the case for vinorelbine, vinflunine and vindesine), the [Madagascar (or rosy) periwinkle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catharanthus_roseus), which has some of the most beautiful flowers, in my opinion, and grows like a weed in North Queensland, where I live. Funny thing is technically speaking this plant is not a periwinkle, which was discovered only after the vinca alkaloids were named after the wrong genus of plants (the word "vinca" refers to the genus of plants to which periwinkles belong to).

I actually wanted to show vincristine, but vincristine has no entries in the Protein Data Bank (PDB).
