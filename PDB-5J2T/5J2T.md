# PDB 5J2T entry
[5J2T](http://www.rcsb.org/structure/5J2T) is a cow (*Bos taurus*) tubulin (chains A and C of alpha-1B and chains D and B of beta-2B)-vinblastine complex, with brown rat (*Rattus norvegicus*) Stathmin-4 (chain E) and Red junglefowl (*Gallus gallus*) tubulin tyrosine ligase (chain F). I actually wanted to show vincristine, but vincristine has no entries in the Protein Data Bank (PDB).
