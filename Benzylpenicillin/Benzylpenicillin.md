Benzylpenicillin, or penicillin G as it is known in the US, is a natural penicillin derived from the *Penicillium chrysogenum* fungus. It is primarily given by intramuscular or intraveous injection and can be used to treat a wide variety of bacterial infections, especially those caused by Gram-positive organisms.
