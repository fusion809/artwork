This wallpaper was generated using open-source software only. It is a Mandelbrot fractal (created using default settings in GIMP) with 3D models, generated in Jmol, of four different chemotherapy drugs on it. I essentially took the models and placed them on a Mandelbrot fractal background in GIMP and exported as a PNG. 

The data used to create the 3D models (i.e. where each atom is, the types of bond between atoms, etc.) was taken from X-ray crystallography data, or PubChem entries, or RCSB PDB and optimized using Avogadro2 (https://github.com/OpenChemistry/avogadroapp). The specific chemo drugs were:

* Doxorubicin (top left), created from RCSB PDB DM2 entry (http://www.rcsb.org/ligand/DM2)
* Imatinib (top right), created from RCSB PDB STI entry (http://www.rcsb.org/ligand/STI)
* Cyclophosphamide (bottom left), created from COD 2005356 entry (http://www.crystallography.net/cod/2005356.html)
* Methotrexate (bottom right), created from PubChem CID 126941 (https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/126941)

They were chosen based on the fact they're some of the most important members of their respective class of chemo drug (anthracyclines, tyrosine kinase inhibitors, alkylating agents and antimetabolites, respectively).
